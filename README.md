Siedler von MÃ¼nchen - A connected Settlers of Catan boardgame implementation

Documentation currently basic, but will be improved in the future. I will also try to add all schematics and files needed for building the board, but for now this repo only consists of the code.

Uni project for the AdvEIsor-program at TUM, winning first place in the 2021/22 competition. The task was to build two boards of a board game which can play with each other over the internet.
For the competitions final, the board only partly worked due to software issues on the client side. Those issues were later fixed by me, requiring reworking most of the code. Almost untouched though remains the sensor, LED and button logic, which was coded by fellow student [avere2001](https://github.com/avere2001), who also designed the custom PCB from scratch. Other team members were involved in building the two boards, hand-soldering all the hall-sensors and writing fragments of the original code, as well as the conceptualization of the project.
